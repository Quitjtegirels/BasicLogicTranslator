# Basic Logic Translator

Basic Logic Translator is a Python script that translates English natural language sentences into logical propositions using symbolic logic notation.

## Features

- Tokenizes natural language sentences into logical propositions.
- Handles negations, provided that, and only if, namely stylistic variants, constructs.
- Supports custom symbolic notation for propositions.
- Provides a command-line interface for input and output.

## How to run

Just execute logictranslator.py and then provide asked inputs.


## Usage
Run 'logictranslator.py' and follow the instructions. It is that simple.

## Documentation


1.miniELIZA function:
Parameters: text (string) - the input text to analyze.
Returns: answer (string) - the response generated by the mini ELIZA system.

2.levenshteinDistance function:
Parameters: a (string), b (string) - the two strings for which to calculate the Levenshtein distance.
Returns: The Levenshtein distance between strings a and b.

3.levenshteinMatrix function:
Parameters: a (string), b (string) - the two strings for which to calculate the Levenshtein distance matrix.
Returns: A matrix representing the Levenshtein distances between all substrings of a and b.

4.NgramLanguageModel class:
Methods:
__init__(self, n, k=1): Initializes the N-gram language model with n as the order of the model and k as a smoothing parameter.
train(self, corpus): Trains the model on the provided corpus.
prob(self, word, context): Calculates the probability of a word occurring given a context.
sample(self, context): Samples a word based on the probability distribution given a context.
generate_sentence(self, max_length=20, start_context=None): Generates a sentence using the model.

5.NaiveBayesClassifierMY class:
Methods:
__init__(self): Initializes the Naive Bayes Classifier.
preprocess(self, X): Preprocesses the input data to generate a vocabulary.
train(self, X, y): Trains the classifier on the provided data.
predict(self, X): Predicts the labels for the input data.

6.LogisticRegression class:
Methods:
__init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000): Initializes the Logistic Regression model with specified learning rate and number of iterations.
sigmoid(self, z): Computes the sigmoid function.
fit(self, X, y): Fits the model to the input data.
predict(self, X): Predicts the labels for the input data.
scaling_input(self, X, feature): Scales the input features.

7.perceptron function:
Parameters: x1 (int), x2 (int), y (int) - inputs and output for training the perceptron.
Returns: None. The function modifies the weights of the perceptron.
